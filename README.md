# The LET Language

A Haskell implementation of the LET language specification from the book *Essentials of Programming Languages*, 3rd edition, by Friedman and Wand. This is only intended as a study project. A reference implementation in Racket is available on [Github](https://github.com/mwand/eopl3).

## TODO

- Improve the parsing module to reduce the use of backtracking.
- Write some more tests for the parts of the language defined in the exercises.
- Haddock-style documentation.
- Write a decent command line interface with optparse or similar.
